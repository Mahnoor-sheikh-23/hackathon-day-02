  <h2>Day-by-Day Progress</h2>

  <h3>Day 1: Business Idea Development 💡</h3>
  <p>
    We began the hackathon by brainstorming and finalizing our business idea. The core concept revolved around creating
    a modern, feature-rich e-commerce website tailored for users to explore, select, and purchase their favorite products
    seamlessly.

  <h3>Day 2: Structure Planning & Documentation 📝</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Defined the schema for the database and created a detailed structural plan.</li>
    <li>Designed a flow diagram to illustrate the workflow of the website.</li>
    <li>Compiled all the technical details and project overview into a comprehensive documentation file.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Day 3: API Integration & Sanity Setup 🔗</h3>
 <p>
    Integrated APIs into the project using <strong>Sanity</strong> as our backend content management system. We also
    implemented external APIs to enhance functionality and provide dynamic data to our website.
  </p>

  <h3>Day 4: Frontend Development & UI/UX Components 🎨</h3>
  <ul>

      <li>And much more!</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Focused on making the website visually appealing and user-friendly.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Tested each feature rigorously, including:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>API integrations to ensure accurate data fetching.</li>
      <li>Add-to-cart functionality to validate proper cart management.</li>
      <li>Search bar implementation to provide seamless product discovery.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Debugged and optimized the code to enhance performance and user experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Day 6: Submission Preparation 📤</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Finalized all project deliverables, including:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>URL links for deployment.</li>
      <li>Performance reports (e.g., GTmetrix results).</li>
      <li>Documentation and test case reports in proper formats.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Ensured every detail was accounted for to meet submission requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Day 7: Gratitude & Reflection ❤️</h3>
  <p>
    We concluded the hackathon by writing a heartfelt thank-you letter to our mentors, especially <strong>Sir Ameen</strong>,
    for their guidance and support throughout the event. This experience was not only a test of our technical skills but also
    a journey of learning, collaboration, and growth.
